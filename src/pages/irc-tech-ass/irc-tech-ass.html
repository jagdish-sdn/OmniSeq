          <br /> Half of US cancer deaths occur in patients with cancers that have on-label immunotherapy indications. These immunotherapy-eligible
          cancers are 37.6% of new cancers (635,340 of 1,688,780) and about half of all cancer deaths (297,819 of 600,000).
          1–3 Data obtained prior to the introduction of immunotherapies showed five-year survival when these cancers become
          advanced was very low (e.g. 4% in lung cancer, 5% in bladder cancer and gastric cancer, 14% in colorectal cancer).
          In comparison, the remarkable survival benefits seen in selected responsive patients following the advent of immunotherapy
          represents an enormous clinical advance. However, identifying which patients will likely benefit from these costly
          and potentially toxic immunotherapies remains a major problem which IRC/CIP aims to address in an efficient and
          cost-effective way.

          <span class="darktext">“checkpoint inhibitors”</span>. Human cancers express variable numbers of antigens which can potentially represent

          This is unlike targeted therapies which work against specific genomic mutations, such as EGFR exon 19 deletions or ALK rearrangements
          in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapies have higher response rates (sometimes over 60%) than
          immunotherapies (often less than 20-30%). While targeted therapies may shrink tumors for a time, cells in the tumors
          that are resistant ultimately take over, resulting in tumor growth and progression. Compared to targeted therapies,
          checkpoint inhibitors give responders an opportunity to experience durable, curative-like results in a subset of
          patient (8- 10%). 4

          Without better use of immune system biomarkers, the problem of low response rates for patients treated will continue, with
          70% or more patients subjected to the adverse effects of these drugs without achieving clinical benefit. The number
          of these drugs is also rapidly increasing, with over 1000 agents or combinations in preclinical development and
          some 3000 different clinical trials underway. 5 The coming wave of combination therapies and additional indications
          from these trials underscores an urgent need for biomarker testing to discern patients who are likely to benefit
          from treatment as well as those who are very unlikely to respond.

          Accumulating evidence in and beyond FDA labeling shows that
          <span class="darktext"> PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC)</span> demonstrates wide variation in prevalence and predictive value for objective
          response rates across tumor types.
          <span class="darktext"> Many now feel the usefulness of PD-L1 IHC is more for “response stratification” (higher and lower levels of clinical

          the tumor and therefore, more abnormal proteins and a more-likely anti-cancer immune response. Unlike PD-L1 IHC,
          MSI testing is technically accurate and has moderate predictive value for checkpoint inhibition response in advanced
          solid tumors. However, the overall prevalence of patients with MSI-high tumors is relatively low (often below 5%).

          <br />
          <br /> The primary clinical management problem faced by oncologists in treating patients with metastatic cancer is that
          they have a single opportunity to select the best initial therapy and want to avoid serious adverse events caused
          by a therapy to which the patient may not respond. The fluctuating predictive value of PD-L1 IHC and the low prevalence
          of positive MSI on-label testing across tumor types makes the decision difficult, and is compounded by the current
          “one-at-a time” approach to immunotherapy biomarker testing.

          <br /> Checkpoint inhibitors block the PD-L1 pathway, which allows the immune system to attack the tumor. PD-L1 pathway
          can be activated when the PD-1 receptor is expressed on activated T-cells. Its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are expressed
          on the surface of cancer cells, dendritic cells or macrophages. When bound together, these molecules inhibit the
          T-cell anti-cancer response. While this is healthy to avoid immune attack on the host, the same mechanism is used
          by tumors to avoid immune attack on themselves.

          To date, the FDA has approved three different PD-L1 IHC antibody tests used for different drugs in different tumor types.
          These include companion diagnostics for pembrolizumab in lung 7 , 8 and gastric/ gastroesophageal cancers 9 , 10
          and as complementary diagnostics in melanoma 5,11 lung 7 , 13 head and neck 14 and urothelial tumors 15,16 as markers

          One of the key problems for oncologists is that it is now known that PD-L1 IHC stratifies, but does not predict response
          to checkpoint inhibitor drugs, as many biomarker negative patients will still respond, sometimes with cure-like
          responses. Thus, PD-L1 IHC results alone cannot determine therapy choices 17 . Another problem is the lower reliability
          of PD-L1 IHC. PD-L1 IHC assays approximate the percentage of immune or tumor cells with qualitative, pathologist-dependent
          scoring systems. Given these challenges, PD-L1 IHC single analyte testing has mostly been employed in non- small
          cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it is “required” as companion diagnostic for pembrolizumab.

          42% response rate to pembrolizumab for NSCLC patients with ≥50% PD-L1 positivity in the KEYNOTE-001 trial. This

          Activation of the PD-L1 pathway can also occur by overexpression of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 through copy number/amplification
          which can be detected by using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). In the largest study to date, the clinical
          significance of PD-L1 IHC and PD-L2 gene copy number gains was evaluated in 654 NSCLC patients. PD-L1 gene amplification
          was found to be independently associated with PD-L1 expression, and PD-L1 gene copy number alterations were highly
          consistent and reproducible compared with the PD-L1 IHC expression. Both PD-L1 amplification and expression were
          predictors of worse survival 33 . Different cancers may have different characteristics. In a study of squamous
          cell carcinoma of the oral cavity for example, PD-L1 amplification was found to have 73% concordance with PD-L1
          expression, with investigators emphasizing the need to perform both measurements to identify potential responders
          to checkpoint blockade across tumor types 34 . Similarly, measurement of PD-L1 by RNA-Seq, was found to improve
          upon the predictive value of testing PD-L1 by IHC alone. In a recent study of more than 400 malignant melanomas,
          mean expression values for PD-L1 testing by IHC and RNA-Seq were highly correlated. Among patients treated with
          checkpoint inhibitors, ORR increased from 56% to 71% for patients expressing PD-L1 by both IHC and RNA-Seq 35 .

          if they are absent. When a tumor is “inflamed”, the dominant immune escape mechanisms are PD-L1 up-regulation and

          of tumor cells with reduced antigenic immunogenicity. When a tumor is “non-inflamed”, the dominant mechanisms of

          oncogenic pathways that alter the tumor microenvironment to exclude T cells, or loss of effector chemokine production

          <span class="darktext">38% (115/304) of patients are positive for at least one checkpoint blockade response marker</span>, including three
          separate measures of PD-L1, TMB and MSI. However, only 20% of these patients (n=63) harbor two or more checkpoint

          The challenge for physicians who are seeking post-immune therapy progression options for patients is that there are hundreds
          of clinical trials for secondary targets that antagonize alternative checkpoint blockade mechanisms or co-stimulate
          immune activity. Patients have very limited tissue available, and doctors have limited time to determine which
          of the many post-progression treatment options are most likely to benefit the patient. Given that well over half
          of all tested patients by IRC have reported high levels of gene expression for only a few of the more than 20 compounds
          in human clinical trials, serial testing by IHC across all permutations to enrich patients onto appropriate combination
          trials is simply not practical. Only Immune Report Card enables physicians to simultaneously screen for over- expression
          across all known secondary targets in clinical trials to provide a rational means for post- progression treatment
          planning.

          The implications of the complex interplay in the tumor microenvironment has been demonstrated where gene expression by RNA-Seq
          of PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CD8 (TILs) and tumor mutational (TMB) burden have not only been independently associated
          with survival, but with varying levels of prognostic significance supporting the use of multiplexed biomarkers
          assays 55 . Both DNA and RNA-level genomics have demonstrated predictive value for checkpoint blockade based therapy
          in metastatic melanoma 26 . Multiplexed immune biomarkers have also been associated with response to pembrolizumab
          across multiple tumor types, indicating the use of these comprehensive biomarkers for improved selection of patients
          for immunotherapy 56 . Assays that combine results for multiple immune markers have been shown to improve effectiveness
          of predicting response to checkpoint inhibition therapy 57 .

          With approximately 15 million Americans living with a cancer history, over $80 billion is spent per year on cancer-related
          care in the U.S. by employers, insurance companies, government programs, cancer patients, and their families. Newly
          diagnosed patients incur their highest out-of-pocket expenses during the first six months of treatment underlining
          oncologists’ need for up-front comprehensive molecular profiling information that optimizes treatment decision
          making to avoid care delays and futile care 58 . At the same time, the use of checkpoint inhibitors for advanced
          cancer patients is expected to grow exponentially with approval of additional drugs and new indications, and the
          typical direct cost of the drugs is currently $10-15k per month checkpoint inhibitors represent an enormous growing
          economic challenge to treating cancer 59 . Assessing the economic utility of biomarkers and genomic technologies
          however, presents unique challenges that are not typically faced outside of healthcare, resulting in lack of methodological
          consensus for evaluation 60 . In cancer care, unlike other types of products, where the economic utility, or “value”
          of a good or service is realized directly by the buyer, it is oncologists who identify appropriate treatment options
          and services that are ultimately selected and paid for by patients

          and other payers. Consequently, the economic utility of comprehensive immune profiling is also shared across physician, patient
          and payer perspectives. For U.S. oncologists, a recent study of the value of in vitro diagnostics (IVD) testing
          found that while IVD costs accounted for approximately 2% of healthcare expenditures, they influence nearly 70%
          of healthcare decisions. Oncologists in the study specifically reported using molecular diagnostics 65% of the
          time in initial patient workups, and rated the testing as having high importance for clinical practice and decision
          making. The authors concluded that while physicians typically overestimated how much was being spent in the U.S.
          on testing, they regarded costs as appropriate and necessary for treatment 61 .

          Recent cost-utility studies specific to immunoncology that take patient health states into account, have demonstrated that
          the use of pembrolizumab in patients NSCLC with high PD-L1 IHC levels (≥50%) increases quality adjusted life years
          (QALYs) and is cost effective compared to standard of care chemotherapy in both the first 62 and second line 63
          settings. In a broader decision-analytic model study based on four phase III trials (CheckMate 017, CheckMate 057,
          KEYNOTE 010, and OAK), data were analyzed from the U.S. Medicare system perspective. The primary study endpoint
          was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year gained from
          immunotherapy compared to docetaxel, with or without PD-L1 IHC expression determining treatment selection. In scenarios
          where second line NSCLC patients are not selected for treatment based on PD- L1 expression, this study found that
          checkpoint inhibition is not cost effective. The investigators in this study concluded that while atezolizumab
          and nivolumab are currently approved for patients with NSCLC who progressed after chemotherapy, from the payers’
          point of view, treating only patients whose tumors express PD-L1 could decrease the budget impact by up to 50%,
          and this may improve access to checkpoint blockade to patients who benefit the most 64 . To illustrate, a meta-analysis
          comparing the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab) by PD-L1 IHC
          expression to standard of care docetaxel in 3,024 previously treated NSCLC patients across 5 clinical trials, a
          positive dose-response relationship was demonstrated between PD-L1 expression levels and survival, with little
          difference in survival by specific checkpoint inhibitor 65 .

          Despite shortcomings in predictive value due to specimen heterogeneity, variability in available antibodies, and reproducibility
          problems PD-L1 IHC has demonstrated cost effectiveness 66 . Given that a major driving factor of diagnostic biomarker
          cost-effectiveness is test accuracy 67 , the cost- effectiveness of PD-L1 IHC can not only be readily extrapolated
          to, but improved upon, by comprehensive immune profiling (CIP). CIP reduces the likelihood of false negative IHC
          testing and directly improves upon the accuracy (negative predictive value) of using PD-L1 IHC as a single biomarker,
          by providing additional checkpoint blockade response markers, including MSI, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and
          tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).

          <span class="darktext">PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</span>
          <br />
          <br /> PD-L1 IHC is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay that measures protein using FDA-approved products, guidelines
          and protocols as a companion or complementary diagnostic for specified indications. Both the analytical and clinical
          validity requirements of the assay were determined by the vendor. In summary, the analytical validity of PD-L1
          IHC analysis is demonstrated by concordance testing validation for approval by NYS CLEP. Immunohistochemistry does
          not meet the traditional criteria of “positive” or “negative” as the pathologist evaluates the pattern of staining.
          PD-L1 IHC specifically characterizes the expression of PD-L1 by calculating the “Tumor Proportion Score”, “Combined
          Positive Score”, or “Percent Immune Cells”. PD-LI IHC 22C3 pharmDx is a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using
          Monoclonal Mouse Anti-PD-L1 Clone 22C3 intended for use in the detection of PD-L1 protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
          (FFPE) tumor tissues. Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) for 22C3 is reported for the majority of tumor types including
          non-small cell lung carcinoma. . A Combined Positive Score (CPS) is reported for gastric and gastroesophageal carcinomas
          using 22C3, The result is defined as positive or negative by the clinician following vendor scoring guidelines
          based on the specific score and the treatment history of the patient. PD-LI IHC 28-8 pharmDx is a qualitative immunohistochemical
          assay using Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-PD-L1, Clone 28-8 is intended for use in the detection of PD-L1 protein in formalin-fixed,
          paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue using En Vision FLEX visualization system on Autostainer Link 48. Percent
          positive tumor cells for 28-8 is reported for melanoma. VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay is a qualitative immunohistochemical
          assay using rabbit monoclonal anti-PD-L1 clone SP142 intended for use in the assessment of the PD-L1 protein in
          formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) urothelial carcinoma tissue stained with OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit
          and OptiView Amplification Kit on a VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA instrument. Percent positive immune cells for SP142
          is reported for cases of urothelial carcinoma.

          <span class="darktext">Microsatellite Instability (PCR)</span>
          <br /> Analytical validation of Microsatellite Instability (MSI) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was designed to assess
          the reproducibility of results and the sensitivity of detection. MSI analysis involves comparison of allelic profiles
          of microsatellite markers generated by amplification of DNA from matching normal and tumor samples (either fresh
          frozen or paraffin-embedded/formalin-fixed tissues). Alleles present in the tumor sample that are not found in
          the corresponding normal samples indicate MSI. The MSI PCR includes fluorescently-labeled primers for the amplification
          of a National Cancer Institute (NCI) recommended panel of five microsatellite markers, consisting of two mononucleotide
          markers (BAT-25, BAT-26) and three dinucleotide repeats (D2S123, D5S346, D17S250). Samples with instability in
          two or more of these markers are defined as MSI-high (MSI- H), whereas those with one unstable marker are designated
          as MSI-low (MSI-L). Samples with no detectable alterations are MS-stable (MSS). This validation of accuracy was
          evaluated in 10 known positive (MSI-H or MSI-L) and 10 known negative (MSS) patient/clinical samples. Several PCR
          reactions (done on different days) demonstrated the reproducibility of the results (Assay Precision). All repeats
          showed identical novel MSI alleles in the reanalyzed samples, representative results follow the tables. In accordance
          with NYS DOH requirement, 3 negative and 3 positive patient samples were assayed in triplicate (intra-assay) and
          three separate runs (inter-assay ) to establish precision/reproducibility. For sensitivity studies, an increasing
          amount of the MSI PCR positive control DNA (HCT 116 cell line) was suspended in DNA extracted from the MSI-negative
          K562 cell line. Several different dilutions were analyzed with 2%, 4%, 8% of the DNA in this mixture (25ng total
          DNA per PCR reaction) coming from the HCT116 cells. The sensitivity limit of the PCR for MSI in the BAT25 and BAT
          26 loci was determined to be 4% of MSI-positive.

          does not meet the traditional criteria of “positive” or “negative” as the pathologist evaluates the pattern of
          staining. CD3/CD8 IHC specifically characterizes the expression of CD3 and CD8 into two distinct patterns: Infiltrating
          or Non-infiltrating. This assay consists of two IHC stains performed on a DAKO auotstainer, standard techniques
          are used to obtain the staining characteristics and infiltrating patterns of the T-cells using CD3 (A0452, Dako)
          and CD8 (M7130, Dako) antibodies. An Infiltrating pattern of staining refers to the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
          (TILs) among neoplastic cells in most of the tumor, while a Non-infiltrating pattern refers to present inconsistently
          infiltrating TILs. The Non-infiltrating pattern of staining includes cases with an abundance of TILs at the advancing
          edge of the neoplasm, but within infiltrating among neoplastic cells. Twenty cases with corresponding pathology
          reports were chosen for this validation based on CD3 and CD8 IHC testing previously performed at Roswell Park Cancer
          Institute (RPCI) for definitive comparison to OmniSeq, Inc. 100% concordance was noted between the original description
          of CD3 and CD8 staining and the two OmniSeq pathologists.

          CD3/CD8 IHC accuracy results were obtained by comparison to RNA-Seq nRPM (normalized reads per million) for these genes.
          Automated image analysis of CD3/CD8 IHC was performed using the Aperio Scanscope (Aperio Technologies, Inc.) based
          on 20X bright-field optical microscopy. nRPM were extracted from the RNA-Seq analysis data for the same specimens.
          The correlation of nRPM for each of the three subunit genes for CD3 to each other were consistently high ranging
          from 0.93 for CD3D versus CD3G, 0.86 for CD3D and CD3E, and 0.84 for CD3E and CD3G. The correlation of CD3 IHC
          to nRPM for each of the three CD3 subunit genes was slightly lower, but consistent at 0.76 for CD3G, 0.75 for CD3D,
          and 0.71 for CD3E. The results for CD8 were similar, with the correlation of nRPM for the two CD8 subunit genes
          CD8A and CD8B at 0.72, and the correlation of CD8 IHC to the average nRPM for CD8 at 0.80.

          acceptable limits, assay sensitivity, assay specificity, reference range (normal cutoff), and reproducibility (test
          precision). These standards were evaluated on 59 solid tumors from the Roswell Park Cancer Institute surgical pathology
          archives divided into 2 groups based upon prior genomic information of the samples and expected result for PD-L1/L2
          amplification. One group consisted of two specimens for which prior clinical or research testing for clinical use
          had shown high level amplification of PD-L1/L2 using next generation sequencing analysis. The other group consisted
          of 57 specimens had prior RNA-seq with a custom immune profiling panel that included PD-L1 expression completed

          by FISH is closely associated with over expression of PD-L1 protein as visualized by IHC methods, while aneuploidy
          has a much lower association.

          variance for a standardized set of samples and Immune Report card next generation sequencing (NGS) run controls.
          The measurement units used to demonstrate analytical validity included gene expression normalized reads per million
          (nRPM) and relative rank (RNA-Seq), as well as absolute TMB counts, normalized TMB counts, and TMB clinical reporting
          interpretation (DNA- seq). Relative rank, which is applicable to RNA-Seq relates nRPM to a reference population
          and provides a value normalized to a score of 100 for each gene. Absolute TMB count is a simple enumeration of
          qualified somatic mutations detected for that sample which is then normalized to 1 megabase of sequence (normalized
          TMB count).

          <span class="darktext">PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</span>
          <br /> PD-L1 (Programmed death-ligand 1) is evaluated in solid tumors to support the appropriate use of checkpoint inhibitor
          therapy. PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is indicated as an aid in identifying NSCLC patients for treatment with pembrolizumab.
          Identifying PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is important in identifying the signal needed to assess which patients
          will respond better to anti-PD-1 therapy. Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx has an expanded label approved by the U.S.
          Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowing detection of PD-L1 expression in a broader range of patients - those
          with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of 1% or more. PD-L1 IHC using 28-8 pharmDx antibody defines protein
          expression as the percentage of tumor cells exhibiting positive membrane staining at any intensity. PD- L1 expression
          as detected by PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx in nonsquamous NSCLC may be associated with enhanced survival from OPDIVO®
          (nivolumab). Positive PD-L1 status as determined by PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx in melanoma is correlated with the magnitude
          of the treatment effect on progression-free survival from OPDIVO. Additionally, determination of PD-L1 status using
          VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) is indication-specific, and evaluation in urothelial carcinoma tissue is based on the proportion
          of tumor area occupied by PD-L1 expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (% IC) of any intensity. PD-L1 expression
          in ≥5% IC determined by VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay in urothelial carcinoma tissue is associated with increased
          objective response rate (ORR) in a non-randomized study of Tecentriq (atezolizumab).

          <span class="darktext">Microsatellite Instability (PCR)</span>
          <br /> Microsatellite markers can be used to detect a form of genomic instability called microsatellite instability which
          is a change in length of a microsatellite allele due to either insertion or deletion of repeating units during
          DNA replication and failure of the DNA mismatch repair system to correct these errors. MSI-H cancers, whether sporadic
          or inherited, are less aggressive than either MSI-L or MSS cancers. They are less often associated with either
          lymphatic or distant spread. Despite being less aggressive, experimental data show that MSI-H cancers are less
          sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and more resistant to adjuvant chemotherapy. These tumors could also differ in
          their response to radiation therapy. To summarize, the evaluation of microsatellites by PCR can be stratified into
          three groups: MSS, MSI-L, and MSI-H based on the detection of microsatellites in a patient’s tumor specimen compared
          to a respective normal specimen. Recently, the approval for the use of checkpoint inhibitors in all solid tumors
          that are MSI-H emphasizes the importance of the evaluation of MSI in cancer patients.

          (cluster of differentiation 8) is one of the co-receptors for the T-cell, it specifically binds to MHC Class I molecules
          and can be reflective of response to checkpoint inhibitors. Specifically, the pattern of TILs within a tumor is
          associated with clinical outcome and response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The immunohistochemical stains for
          CD3 and CD8 are used to characterize T-cells and cyotoxic T-cells in solid tumors which may be amenable to immunotherapy.
          The information provided by the pattern of CD3 and CD8 IHC may be used to by physicians to decide if immunotherapy
          with one or more FDA- approved checkpoint inhibitors may benefit the patient.

          to expected values, or reference intervals, which refers to range of test values expected to occur in 95% of healthy
          individuals. For this FISH assay the upper cutoff for results was a series of normal tissues (including normal
          lung, lymph node, kidney, or adipose tissue with validation tumor in the same slide) with a calculated 95% confidence
          interval for probe signal patters seen in these tissues.

          To summarize, amplification involving the PD-L1/L2 genes can be expected to occur in 1 to 5% solid tumors 34,69–73 , and
          is associated with over expression of PD-L1. A diploid copy number state for PD- L1/L2 is further evidence of a
          lack of over expression of PD-L1 by IHC and not supportive of potential response to checkpoint inhibition therapy.
          Aneuploidy or copy number gain of PD-L1/L2 is frequently associated with over expression of PD-L1/L2 by IHC and
          supportive of potential response to checkpoint inhibition therapy. It should also be recognized that a subset of
          samples that show over expression of PD-L1/L2 by IHC have a diploid status for PD-L1/L2 and a no gain result cannot
          be used to predict potential response to checkpoint inhibition therapy.

          For the clinical validation of RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq, we demonstrated that: 1) measurement of immune response in the tumor
          microenvironment for the TILs and TCRS gene expression signatures (RNA-seq) which are not confirmed to the neoplastic
          cells results are accurate; 2) concordance with fresh frozen samples when using FFPE samples and that that different
          sections of tissue from a given tumor do not result in different clinical interpretations; 3) tissue characteristics
          have a broad tolerance for impacting the RNA-seq results, and; 4) the specimen choice for testing either multiple
          foci of metastatic tumor or the primary tumor has very limited impact on the final results for most patients. For
          the DNA-seq results the evaluation for TMB (DNA-seq) is limited to neoplastic cells, and the most important component
          of clinical validation defined cut-off values for high versus not high TMB that is consistent with the clinical
          literature for response to checkpoint blockade.

          Using multiple unique cohorts of patients, we have shown that the TILs, TCRS, and TMB identify the phenotypes of interest
          reliably and accurately from DNA and RNA prepared from FFPE tumor specimens. Our in-depth analysis of the TILs
          and TCRS signatures using the RNA-seq data showed that the results are accurate and not influenced by specimen
          characteristics or sequencing variables outside of the standard thresholds for the latter. More importantly, we
          showed a method using relative rank analysis that allows for the comparison of future patient results to a reference
          population. In a similar manner, we built a class interpretation for TMB that is unique to our targeted panel and
          bioinformatics pipeline. The resultant gene expression relative rank (1 to 100) TMB category (very low to very
          high) for each patient provides clinicians with an interpretation of results that otherwise would not be possible
          if all that was available was nRPM or number of mutations detected.
